Each commit is identified by a unique SHA-1 hash, contains a descriptive message explaining the changes, and references the previous commit, forming a version history.</li> <li>Branches: Branches allow developers to work on separate lines of development. The primary branch is usually called 'master' or 'main', while feature branches enable the development of new features or bug-fix branches for addressing issues without affecting the main codebase.</li> <li>Merge: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.

How well can ICON simulate that? During a case study ICON stays close to 0\u00b0C even for temperatures going down to -15\u00b0C. Reach out if you also want to compare model output to measurements.</p> <p>GdM talks about pressure bias for which they have found potential causes. The boundary values are fixed and should not have been considered. Tried to use ICON-EU boundary condition but doesn't change problem either.</p> <p>AW works on GPU porting. Will soon have  MeteoSwiss virtual clusters on ALPS and run benchmarks. Is still working on sspt implementation. Did not handle wind correctly, should always provide wind components on lat-lon grid. BC asks which remapping tool he is using. AW uses iconremap within ICONtools. SS asks if problems only apply to wind field or also other variables? AW answer that wind fields are special because they are vectors.</p> <p>SS does ICON-NWP simulation and looks at tracer transport.</p> <p>VC worked on the benchmarks and was working on the icon-vis repo with pspylot on using grib files.</p> <p>MS uses ICON-ART simulations. Wants to estimate methane emissions over Europe.</p> <p>KI is working on coupling FLEXPART. Compared point sourced emission between ICON-ART and FLEXPART. Next step: couple complete landscape.</p> <p>DO from EMPA is working on porting parts of ICON-ART to GPU. First step is to decide from which ICON version to start the development. It has to fit ART part.</p> <p>RP works in Daniela Domeisen's group at the University of Lausanne. He works on teleconnection. </p> <p>ER joined Daniela's group in November, working in the project heat forecast. He started experiments with dry dynamical cores.</p> <p>NO works with ICON-NWP using 2-moment scheme. Interested in low-stratus clouds.</p> <p>SR presents aqua-planet simulations by Sebastian Schemm . Next step: add seasonal cycle and topography. They also work on improving ecRad with machine learning. OF says that they have a bit of experience to implement machine learning into Fortran code and could maybe help. WS asks if aqua-planet connected with the EXCLAIM use case. SR is not sure because he is not completely involved.</p> <p>SF works with ICON-HAM. Upgraded ICON base version to 2.6.4 release. Elsa Germann is checking GPU port after upgrade. It runs but doesn't validate. They have now ICON-HAM version, which is tuned.</p> <p>BC simulates long-term and global changes. Teamed up with ER and Priyanka Yadav. Happy for more people to team up with. WS asks if the use ECHAM physics? BC answers yes but nothing against ICON-NWP physics. WS thinks that for now ECHAM physics is the right choice.</p> <p>DF is using coarse resolution. Teamed up with ER, BC and Priyanka Yadav.</p> <p>WS is talking about the use cases of EXCLAIM. The software development is trying to pull components out of ICON models to remove deprecated code.  They want to clean up the release candidate 2.6.5. Several components will probably disappear, e.g., old radiation scheme (PSrad).  Asks if there are users of LES and if someone would have a problem if it would be removed in the release candidate. The graupel microphysics will be turned into stand-alone component with GT4py tool to run components on GPU or CPU. MeteoSwiss will have access to new cluster on ALPS. The cray compiler is going to support OpenACC again. SF comments that NO will use LES in her PhD. Asks where to find ICON consolidated. WS says that GitLab is repository for all ICON code and changes should be documented in wiki. You should have access to ICON consolidated AW asks if the cray compiler is a second besides NVIDIA. WS answers yes but that they don't have benchmarks. NVIDIA can do better and should be preferred.</p> <p>CO is working on DSLs. Working on dynamic core of ICON.</p> <p>AS wants to introduce the Inorganic Environmental Geochemistry group to ICON.

PS answers that the grid information is needed, which can also be in a separate file. It is straightforward to merge multiple files. So if the cf-conventions are fulfilled, there should be no problem. You can always send PS a file and he can help you.</p> <p>WS asks at which resolution psyplot breaks down. PS answers that psyplot is still using matplotlib, which is not very well suited for high resolution. For about 4 Mio grid points it takes about 1 minute. Hope would be to use something different, maybe PyVista or VDK. WS asks what the maximum is, which psyplot can use. PS answers that it should be R3B7, which is roughly 3 Mio grid cells.</p> <p>CO asks if PS has discussed with VDK. PS answers that the first goal of psyplot is just to visualise. He doesn't think they have currently resources for that but maybe in the future.</p> <p>DF comments that ParaView can handle data on big scale, so why not trying to get VDK with  ParaView. PS answers that for  ParaView the idea is different. It is a visualization focus framework and has a very general scope, not primarily made for visualizing model output. DF asks if it is too complicated to use. PS answers yes and the scope is different. Most scientist working with model output are using command line tools.</p> <p>VC struggled to do a plot with normal wind components and asks if there is maybe a problem if the variables are defined on the edge or node.

MeteoSwiss wants to run ICON operationally next year. SW shows slides about her current work on transparent stratus clouds in ICON .  Observations - model comparison shows that ICON is not predicting thick stratus clouds.  The predicted clouds mainly cover 60-80% but never 100% as in reality. This has a negative impact on correct radiation prediction with a bias of 100 W/m2. SW tries to motivate Martin to work on this. SW is in contact with Israeli colleagues who have introduced a nonphysical ad-hoc parameter to improve cloud cover in the Mediterranean to deal with this issue.

SS says that they work in collaboration with the SDSC. The offline performance is close to the performance to what is possible. Currently machine learning based radiation schemes are being linked to ICON. GC shows plot about memory vs. performance for the neural network and a random forest. The precision of the random forest is close to the precision of the neural network. For reaching such close results, the complexity of the random forest needs to be increased, which makes it too large to be used. SS says that the important lesson learnt is that the neural network consumes much less memory given a certain error tolerance. The memory aspect is also very import for EXCLAIM.</p> <p>CSP asks if they intend to use it in later simulations and if there is any connection with EXCLAIM. SS says that it is part of the effort to accelerate the code. They want to use an aqua planet to see if it generalizes and to see if the original code and the neural network both predict radiation also in summer.</p> <p>MA asks what the general motivation is.

They could reduce the number of calls with ecRAD and speed up and improve it at the same time.</p> <p>MA asks if it improves because of a higher resolution in time and space.  SS says that the comparison of ecRAD vs. satellite data shows a larger error, than the comparison of machine learning against ecRAD. </p> <p>AH asks how big the training algorithm is, if it is unsupervised and how general it is.

SS says that they are testing the generalization abilities. The quality of the results is relatively low for completely unseen data. Thus, it is not useful for climate simulation yet but for weather prediction. Retraining the neural network is not so expensive to hinder them from doing it, but the generalization is the big question mark.</p> <p>AH asks if they are using 3D data for the neural network. SS says that they cannot afford to use 3D for long simulations, but one gains something by taking the neighbors into account by using convolutions.</p> <p>BG asks if there will by a hybrid format for ICON or if it is planned to be used as a full scaled replacement for the ecRAD scheme.

He starts with the ICON port to LUMI , which is being done by the Max Planck institute, CSC, and others. This endeavor turned into a significant project, and although they have something running, they face challenges as they rely on the Cray compiler, which has significant bugs. On a positive note, progress has been made, and they have a 1.25km test running. WS emphasizes the hope that HPE can fix the compiler bugs soon, preferably before LUMI gets decommissioned. However, there is still a lot of work to be done. To assist with the project, Cray has provided an entire person to help out.</p> <p>MA asks about the client for this implementation.</p> <p>WS responds that the first client is a Swedish team, although the name escaped him. Other users are interested in performing high-resolution runs.</p> <p>MA inquires about the timeline.</p> <p>WS admits that there is a bit of frustration and they had hoped to complete it during the acceptance phase.

The plan is to incrementally refactor it, which is challenging because every change has to pass all the buildbot. Thus it is a lot of work to integrate it.</p> <p>WS mentions that they received the first Grace-Hopper node, which serves as the basis for ALPS. They have been working on benchmarking it to determine the energy usage of certain runs, such as ICON-CPU on Grace and ICON-GPU on Hopper. They are also considering DSL (Domain Specific Language) usage.</p> <p>JJ asks for a date when the machines will be available to test workflows.</p> <p>WS explains that the node they have now will not be accessible, but they will have access to an ALPS subset. They cannot provide an exact date at the moment but hope to have something available for the hackathon. Their best estimate is November or December, but they make no promises.</p> <p>MA questions if the port to Grace-Hopper will be as challenging as the port to LUMI.</p> <p>WS believes it should not be as challenging since they are working with a reliable (NVIDIA) compiler.

R2B9 shows improvement but still doesn't match R2B7.</p> <p>DL asks if WS can correlate the different steps. There are various steps in R2B7.</p> <p>WS explains that initialization is a key step, and in the first timestep, reading boundary conditions takes a significant amount of time. This process is much quicker for lower resolutions.</p> <p>DL remarks that it would be valuable to have these results documented somewhere on the wiki. He also speculates that WS has many tricks for conducting benchmarks and asks if WS could share them.</p> <p>WS responds that he will definitely share those tricks. He mentions there's no decision yet on enabling low-noise mode but assures that there will be at least one partition available with low-noise mode.</p> <p>DL then mentions he's working on a recommended configuration. He asks if not using just-fit mode instantly drops below 50%.</p> <p>WS clarifies that it doesn't. Personally, WS disagrees with using just-fit mode and suggests running on the best-fit configuration instead. He points out that the machine is so powerful that it will still yield a good time-to-solution.</p> <p>FB mentions she is writing a proposal using ICON-CLM, which is still in the development phase for GPU porting. They tested it on Daint because it doesn't run on ALPS. Maria Grazia mentioned that scaling on Daint will likely be rejected.</p> <p>WS responds that Maria Grazia mentioned they can apply for an account to conduct early testing.</p> <p>FB adds that ICON-CLM is not finalized yet and hasn't been tested on pre-ALPS systems.</p> <p>MJ notes they have a similar setup and could potentially run it on ALPS. They ask if FB can use WS's benchmarking.</p> <p>WS confirms FB can use their benchmarking, but it's a different configuration. WS isn't sure if this could be a reason for rejection. WS offers asking Maria Grazia if that would help.</p> <p>ML suggests that benchmarking for ICON-NWP could also be useful for ICON-CLM. They ask if WS could share the namelist.</p> <p>WS agrees to share the namelist and mentions that he  can also provide access to weak scalability tests for certain people.</p> <p>DB asks how much faster a given configuration runs on Alps compared to Daint and if one can estimate from that comparison.</p> <p>WS responds that If you run GPU-to-GPU configuration, Alps is roughly a factor of 9 faster. However, this approach wouldn't fully utilize memory, so you would use fewer nodes.</p> <p>JC asks about the power cap per cabinet.</p> <p>WS corrects that it's actually per GPU. In terms of energy-to-solution, you can make it run faster but not in a linear way. Grace CPU is very powerful and shares memory with GPU. Some people may want to run components on CPU, but this gives priority to the CPU, potentially slowing down the GPU. WS notes they need to caution users because running large components on the CPU might not perform well. Ocean-atmosphere coupling is an example of such a component. CSCS is advocating for a GPU port to address these issues.</p> <p>ML asks how reducing the cap would affect scaling.</p> <p>WS responds that it would likely improve scaling, but emphasizes that setting the power cap involves political decisions.</p> <p>ML queries if the power cap could vary across different clusters.</p> <p>WS replies that he is unsure but can inquire about it.</p> <p>DF mentions that all tests were conducted within one cabinet and asks if it's expected for individual jobs to run within a single cabinet.</p> <p>WS responds by mentioning they ran other tests (R2B11) that did not fit into one cabinet, noting it had minimal impact.</p> <p>ML comments that a virtual cluster cap may not work because it's virtual.</p> <p>WS admits he's uncertain about how elastic it is and plans to revisit the issue.</p> <p>WS states he will discuss what information can be shared on the wiki and will inquire with Maria Grazia about whether benchmarks from Daint are sufficient.</p>"},{"location":"events/icon_meetings/2024-3/","title":"ICON Meeting 2024/3","text":"<p>17 September 2024, ETH Zurich (L 17.1) and via Zoom</p>"},{"location":"events/icon_meetings/2024-3/#participants-on-site","title":"Participants (on-site)","text":"<p>Michael J\u00e4hn (MJ), Matthieu Leclair (ML), Annika Lauber (AL), Tina Schnadt (TS), Doris Folini (DF), Anurag Dipankar (AD), Diego Villanueva (AV), Andrina Caratsch (AC)</p>"},{"location":"events/icon_meetings/2024-3/#participants-zoom","title":"Participants (Zoom)","text":"<p>Matthias Kraushaar (MK), Marco Arpagaus (MA), Brigitta Goger (BG), Arash Hamzehloo (AH), Mikael Stellio (MS), Christian Steger (CS), Will Sawyer (WS), Nander Wever (NW)</p> <p>Minutes by Annika Lauber</p>"},{"location":"events/icon_meetings/2024-3/#reports","title":"Reports","text":""},{"location":"events/icon_meetings/2024-3/#c2sm-michael-jahn-annika-lauber-matthieu-leclair","title":"C2SM (Michael J\u00e4hn, Annika Lauber, Matthieu Leclair)","text":"<p>MJ welcomes everyone and shares the latest news about ICON from C2SM .</p> <p>AD asks about the transient aerosol port and who helped fix the bug. AL explains that many people were involved, including DWD, C2SM, and MPI, and that there were actually three bugs, which made the issue difficult to identify. MJ adds that finishing up the port also takes longer now because so many people are involved, requiring a lot of communication and waiting.</p> <p>WS asks if preparatory projects can really be submitted at any time. MK answers that while project proposals are gathered for specific deadlines, preparatory projects can be submitted at any time.</p> <p>CS asks about the namelist variable <code>isolrad</code> and what it does. MJ responds that he can't say much, as he hasn't really looked into it yet.</p> <p>AH wants to ask about ALPS and mentions that they were given access to Daint but don\u2019t have a user environment set up there and are struggling with ICON on the new system. Erik Koene tried compiling ICON with MJ\u2019s help and was successful. AH asks if they should have access to S\u00e4ntis instead of Daint. ML responds that this is a question for CSCS and depends on their decision\u2014whether weather and climate work will be limited to S\u00e4ntis or shared between S\u00e4ntis and T\u00f6di. Ben Cumming thought that everything should run on S\u00e4ntis. Once CSCS provides more details, they will offer support. ML asks if AH's access is part of a preparatory project, but AH clarifies that it\u2019s a larger project and they believed they had admin rights to create a user environment. ML confirms they do, but advises that for now, they should rely on what is already available.</p> <p>MK adds that the differences between T\u00f6di, S\u00e4ntis, and Daint will be minimal, and the systems should function the same way. Admin rights are not necessary to create a user environment, but it will take some time to adapt to the new system. MK suggests the possibility of tagging user environments for specific systems, although most should be visible. He also shares the following links:</p> <ul> <li>GitHub repo UserLabDay </li> </ul> <p>AH asks whether Daint or S\u00e4ntis will be the long-term solution for their applications. MK explains that S\u00e4ntis will be mainly dedicated to climate and weather, specifically for ICON (EXCLAIM), while a few tasks will still go to Daint. DF mentions that their colleagues are currently doing benchmarking on T\u00f6di, but are now on Daint.Alps, where certain images were missing. DF asks if those images will be available. ML advises not to rely on his images anymore, explaining that there's a workaround using the user environment. You can query the database to see what's installed on the system. DF asks if this is possible even without T\u00f6di access, and ML thinks it is.</p> <p>DF then asks if they can expect the images from T\u00f6di to be available on Daint. ML replies that although it's not a long-term solution, those images should eventually be deployed on Daint. However, it won\u2019t be as straightforward. DF points out that many people need to complete benchmarking by October. AH asks if ICON can be compiled by loading the user environment without those missing images. ML explains that the software stack image is the same as the user environment and can be accessed on each cluster, but using it isn't always straightforward. Currently, the images are interchangeable, though they still depend on the operating system. In the future, user environments on one cluster may not work on another. MK confirms that the risk of incompatibility exists and they've already seen this with MCH. Regarding the missing images on Daint, MK explains that the NVIDIA part wasn\u2019t provided completely, which is why he created another environment. These images are not preloaded on the system, so users need to search for them using the user environment tool. MK suggests trying the command <code>uenv image find -s todi</code> to locate the images.</p> <p>BG mentions using T\u00f6di and that while the instructions on C2SM initially worked, two weeks later the executables stopped working and the instructions disappeared. ML responds that there is now an Alps section on the landing page. It should be possible to do the same tasks as before, but without using absolute paths to his environment. Instead, tags can be used. The updated instructions are available on the workshop materials page  as well as the user landing page . ML encourages anybody to reach out to him on Slack if any issues arise.</p> <p>AD from Empa asks if ML has managed to run ICON-ART. ML responds that he has only been testing regular ICON, but Erik was successful in compiling it. AH confirms that Erik followed a workaround. AD asks if there is a plan for C2SM to support ICON-ART. ML explains that ICON-ART is not in the C2SM pipeline and suggests that users create a test case, and C2SM can help set up the CI infrastructure. AH mentions they have an old test case (icon-kit) that needs updating. MJ adds that ICON-ART is now part of ICON-NWP, and a test case could be set up and added.</p> <p>DF asks about using default ICON versions and whether the run scripts will be used on Alps in the same way. ML replies that it\u2019s not yet finalized for ICON. DF inquires about a timeline, and ML says it will still take some time. MJ mentions they will provide the latest OS release and testing.</p> <p>WS brings up that Jonas integrated the CSCS-CI into the normal BuildBot workflow, and much of the software is available. They set up a service user and have a project for that but still need to complete a few tasks before Jonas returns. There\u2019s a discussion about the mechanism for triggering the runners, and they will need to talk to Ralf and Sergey. WS estimates that it will take three to four weeks until the CI system is fully operational, aiming for the end of October to overlap with Piz Daint.</p> <p>DF shares her experience from last week, where she had to furnish a run script herself for a simple test case (heldsuarez). She asks if they should use the job reporting tool suggested by CSCS. WS says they\u2019ll need to discuss that further, as he\u2019s not directly involved.
