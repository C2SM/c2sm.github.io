# EXTPAR

EXTPAR (**Ext**ernal **Par**ameters for Numerical Weather Prediction and Climate Application)
is used to prepare the external parameter data files that are used as input for the ICON model.

All information around this software can be found at the
[official EXTPAR documentation](https://c2sm.github.io/extpar/).

## Support status

The `master` branch is continuously being tested on `co2` (ETHZ) and `levante` (DKRZ).

## Web Interface

Currently, C2SM in collaboration with MeteoSwiss and DWD is preparing a web interface
for generating external parameter files on the ICON grid. A first beta version will be
launched in March 2025.
