# SPICE

SPICE stands for **S**tarter **P**ackage for **I**CON-**C**LM **E**xperiments. It is a processing chain that handles pre-processing of the input,
setting up namelists, running the simulation and archiving/post-processing. It contains the latest setup for ICON-CLM
runs by the CLM community.

The code has been adapted for running on Alps and can be downloaded via [Zenodo :material-open-in-new:](https://zenodo.org/records/10047021){:target="_blank"}.
