The Processing Chain is a collection of Python scripts to prepare necessary input data, submit compute jobs to the SLURM queue
and to apply post-processing steps to many pre-defined setups of the COSMO and ICON models. 
In addition to their standard versions, it can als handle several variants of these models, namely COSMO-GHG, COSMO-ART and ICON-ART.
The chain can be flexibly adapted according to your needs, e.g., by creating your own case, adding new jobs or custom scripts.

The code is the product of a joint collaboration between Empa and C2SM. 
It was originally developed by Christoph Knote using pure Bash scripts.
In 2018, Empa's [Atmospheric Modelling and Remote Sensing group :material-open-in-new:](https://www.empa.ch/web/s503/modelling-remote-sensing){:target="_blank"} translated the code into Python,
making it more flexible and easier to maintain.

Since 2021, the Processing Chain has been distributed to the entire C2SM
community and is being hosted on the [C2SM GitHub organisation :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/C2SM/processing-chain/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you need any help, please contact [Michael Jähn :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/the-center/people/person-detail.html?persid=286091){:target="_blank"}.
