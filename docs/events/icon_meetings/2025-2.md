## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Matthieu Leclair, Annika Lauber, Mikael Stellio)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/jMaHJdkyKR7bgRT){:target="_blank"}.

### Christian Zeman
- Supporting EXCLAIM simulations from Praveen: quality checks, etc.
- Setup for 3km EURO-CORDEX (no nesting at the moment)
- Supervising Bachelor thesis on mixed-precision in ICON

### Marius Rixen
- Working on extreme events
- Running ICON at different resolutions to study effects
- Wants to run ensembles - looking for help on how to best do this

### Morgane Lalonde
- Working on JSBACH (surface model component)
- Groundwater simulations

### Seraphine Hauser
- ICON-NWP in limited-area mode
- Playing around with different boundary conditions
- Also testing different resolutions (3–50 km)
- Modifying impact of latent heat release

### Ryan Vella
- Cloud microphysics with ICON-HAM and ICON-NWP
- Geoengineering study
- Recently started using ICON-NWP

### Andrea Stenke
- Using ICON-ART on Euler to simulate atmospheric cycling of trace elements
- Open PhD position for modeling atmospheric selenium with ICON-ART (published on ETH job site)

### Victoria Bauer
- ICON-CLM with ERA5 to implement climatological soil moisture
- Trying to use ComIn for this, but not running yet
- In parallel, trying to get JSBACH running in limited-area mode

### Arash Hamzehloo
- Porting components of ICON-ART to GPUs
- Modules related to emissions already done
- Started looking into aerosols and chemistry for GPUs

### Dominik Brunner
- Group focuses on atmospheric composition with ICON-ART
- Submitted application in ICON-ART project (led by Ali, KIT)
- Extensive use of inverse filtering
- Finished study estimating CO_2 emissions in Zurich
- Methane study over Romania; airborne sensor measures direct methane sources
- Active in chemistry modeling; future air pollution of Europe project running parallel to Speed2Zero
- ComIn: working extensively with it. Bachelor student is implementing Python interface to make data extraction during ICON simulation flexible. Not on GPU yet but in contact with ComIn developers. The interface will be shared with the community. It enables the extraction of tracer fields and other data. The grid information remains on CPU as they are currently unable to copy it to GPU

### Christoph Müller
- At MeteoSwiss but working for EXCLAIM
- Trying to develop a Python version of the dycore
- Collaborating with others to speed up dycore, aiming for 10–40% speedup. If successful, MCH is considering it for production
- Daniel Hupp and CM will have a master student testing single precision in dycore
- Possible collaboration with CZ’s student (no guarantee)

### Mauro Bianco
- Trying to get dycore in Python to outperform OpenACC version
- Working on data compression schemes
- Developing CW platform
- Implementing ICON in Python without any Fortran; can use Fortran components, but main code will be Python. Aim to run ideal cases by the end of the year


### Christian Steger
- Working at MeteoSwiss (not to be confused with CS at DWD)
- Working in NWP group; currently working on EXTPAR
- Involved in Copernicus; useful for very high resolution, e.g., large eddy simulations
- Still working on radiation topography scheme
- Backend fields in Fortran. New dataset available at 1 km resolution
