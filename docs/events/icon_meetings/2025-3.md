TODO: update link
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/nMrj3n2NWH9mGsW){:target="_blank"}.


CZ asks if there is a limit in space on cws01. MJ says that we currently have 200TB (?).

JC asks if they can store the input data for icon4py there. MJ says yes.


### Dominik Brunner
Talks about ODIN.

MaL ComIN by design happens in serial way. You see no performance reduction because it's light enough. DB yes it lights engough. A heavier one would slow it down.
SF: ComIn is not a coupler. Not meant to be a coupler (that's what developers always point out).
DM but the MESSY(?) peoply use it more like a coupler.

MJ: how much work would it be to make it work for nested domains.
DB no applications yet for that. All you need to do is access full grid information. Doesn't think it will be very difficult. Currently taylored to EMPA usecase. Happy to get other users and get feedback if it's too specific.

DL Do you know if there is a central registry of ComIn plugins.
DB there are ComIN selections but there is no place where it is shown, which interfaces are already available. Should be brought to thde developers.
SF idea was discussed. Florian Prill found this idea very interesting, so it probably something to come to life at some point.
