## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Matthieu Leclair, Annika Lauber, Mikael Stellio)
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/bdyGkqs7irGbdb3){:target="_blank"}.

CZ askes whether there is a storage limit on cws01. MJ respondes that the system currently has approximately 200 TB available.

JC asks whether input data for ICON4Py can be stored there. MJ confirms that this is probably possible.


### Dominik Brunner
[Presentation about ODIN :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/gwgYDSoxpGYp2wZ){:target="_blank"}.

MaL points out that ComIn operates in a serial manner by design and asks if no performance reduction is observed because the workload is sufficiently light. DB confirmed that the current implementation is lightweight, noting that a heavier configuration would slow the process.

SF states that ComIn is not a coupler and is not intended to serve as one, which developers regularly emphasize. DM observed that the MESSy interface nevertheless uses ComIn a coupler-like manner.

MJ asks how much effort would be required to enable ComIn to work with nested domains. DB replies that there are currently no applications requiring this functionality. He explains that the main requirement would be access to full grid information and does not expect this to be very difficult. He adds that the current setup is tailored to the EMPA use case and welcomes additional users and feedback to assess whether the design is too specific.

DL asks whether a central registry of ComIn plugins exists. DB states that while ComIn selections are available, there is no central location showing which interfaces already exist, and suggestes raising this with the developers. SF states that the idea had been discussed previously and notes that Florian Prill found the concept promising, so such a registry may be developed in the future.
