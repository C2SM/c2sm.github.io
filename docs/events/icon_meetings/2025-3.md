## Reports

### C2SM (Michael Jähn, Matthieu Leclair, Annika Lauber, Mikael Stellio)
TODO: update link
MJ welcomes everyone and shares the [latest news about ICON from C2SM :material-download:](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/nMrj3n2NWH9mGsW){:target="_blank"}.


CZ asks if there is a limit in space on cws01. MJ says that we currently have 200TB (?).

JC asks if they can store the input data for icon4py there. MJ says yes.


### Dominik Brunner
Talks about ODIN.

MaL ComIN by design happens in serial way. You see no performance reduction because it's light enough. DB yes it lights engough. A heavier one would slow it down.
SF: ComIn is not a coupler. Not meant to be a coupler (that's what developers always point out).
DM but the MESSY(?) peoply use it more like a coupler.

MJ: how much work would it be to make it work for nested domains.
DB no applications yet for that. All you need to do is access full grid information. Doesn't think it will be very difficult. Currently taylored to EMPA usecase. Happy to get other users and get feedback if it's too specific.

DL Do you know if there is a central registry of ComIn plugins.
DB there are ComIN selections but there is no place where it is shown, which interfaces are already available. Should be brought to thde developers.
SF idea was discussed. Florian Prill found this idea very interesting, so it probably something to come to life at some point.



### Christian Zeman
Plan to do DYOMAND run with and without convection; may already use SIROCCO.

### Marius Rixen
Resolution-sensitivity studies for mesoscale circulation.

### Morgane Lalonde
Development work in JSBACH.

### Hernandez Urbide Santiago
Running model over South America at 5 km resolution; investigating why and how convection changes in the future.

### Laurenz Roither
New PhD student in Andreas Prein's group; working with ensemble boosting in the Alps;

### Corina Keller
Using ICON-ART for studying air-quality impact and the influence of mitigation; integrating code developments into ART master.

### Arash Hamzehloo
Porting ART module to GPUs.

### David Leutwyler
Working on parameter tuning for convection runs; looking at gust parametrization by Günther Zängl.

### Alina Yapparova
Data assimilation of 3D radar reflectivity to improve precipitation forecasts.

### Christian Steger
- Implementing new topographies in EXTPAR (including COPERNICUS dataset)
- Working on radiation topography parametrization in ICON; documentation available online now
- Sub-grid scheme implemented and ready for testing
- Investigating update of background albedo in EXTPAR; Severe artifacts have been found for complex terrain - trying to solve this

### Jacopo Canton
- Working with high resolution urban modeling.
- Working with ICON4Py. 

### Doris Folini
Interest in idealized setups; studying extreme-event behavior under idealized conditions
