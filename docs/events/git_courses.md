C2SM offers two annual Git courses as part of our [technical training :material-open-in-new:](https://c2sm.ethz.ch/education/technical-training.html){:target="_blank"}.
The **Git for Beginners** course provides an introduction to basic Git commands. For users who already have some experience with Git, we recommend to join our **Git for Advanced** workshop, which focuses on improved workflow and advanced Git commands.
