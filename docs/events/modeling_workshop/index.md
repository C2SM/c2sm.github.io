# C2SM Modeling Workshop

The annual C2SM Modeling Workshop is a rather informal and interactive one-day event with the aim to bring together users and developers of the ICON and CESM models, to share experiences and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving those models. 
 
Until 2025, the workshop was named (COSMO-)ICON User Workshop. Now it is called "C2SM Modeling Workshop", reflecting that contributions from all C2SM-supported models are welcome.
