# ICON User Workshop

The annual ICON User Workshop is a rather informal one-day event with the aim to bring together users and developers of the model, to share experiences and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving ICON. 
 
Before 2025, the workshop was named COSMO-ICON User Workshop.
