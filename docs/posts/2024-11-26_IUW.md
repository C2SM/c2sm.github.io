The ICON User Workshop is a rather informal one-day event with the aim to bring together users and developers of the model, to share experiences and knowledge, and to get insights into some projects involving ICON. The program will include both talks and extended poster sessions. Talks will be limited to a few keynote presentations.
The length of the talks is flexible, , with each talk lasting between 10 and 30 minutes. The authors of the posters will have the opportunity to present their work during the poster session.

Review last year's [contributions](../events/modeling_workshop/2024.md) for inspiration.
 
Please register for the workshop by sending an email to jonas.jucker(at)c2sm.ethz.ch by 18 December 2024.
