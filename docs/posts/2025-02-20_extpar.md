# EXTPAR: New release v5.15 and documentation available

A new release of the [EXTPAR](../tools/extpar.md) software has been published today. It includes several bug fixes, new features, automatic container deployment and a new documentation. 

<!-- more -->

The documentation is now public. It combines several README files and the "User and Implementation Guide", which was previously a LaTeX PDF included with each release. It now has all the advantages of a documentation page, such as better readability, search function, section links, etc.
