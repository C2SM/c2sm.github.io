# EXTPAR: New release v5.15 and documentation available

A new release of the [EXTPAR](../tools/extpar.md) software has been published to today. This comes along with several 
bugfixes, new features, automatic container deployment and a new documentation. 

<!-- more -->

The documentation is now publicly available and has been compiled from several README files and the “User and Implementation Guide”, the existing LaTeX document that was previously made available as a PDF with each new version. Now it has all the advantages of a documentation page, such as better readability, search function, section links, etc.
