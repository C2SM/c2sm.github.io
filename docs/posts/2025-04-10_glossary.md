# Glossary now available

We are excited to share that a Glossary has been added to our landing page!

It includes most — if not all — of the abbreviations and technical terms used throughout our site. This is especially helpful for new C2SM members who may not yet be familiar with all the jargon.

Curious about what SPICE has to do with limited-area modeling? Or wondering about the difference between CESM and C2SM?
You will find the answers in the [Glossary](../glossary/index.md) — check it out!
