# Models

C2SM supports the three weather and climate models [ICON](icon/index.md), [COSMO](cosmo.md), and [CESM](cesm.md), along with associated pre- and post-processing tools, on different high-performance platforms. This page provides an overview, along with detailed documentation and manuals for each required software component to run simulations using these specific models.
