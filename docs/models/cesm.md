# CESM

The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a fully-coupled,
global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past,
present, and future climate states. For more info please see the [CESM Homepage :material-open-in-new:](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
