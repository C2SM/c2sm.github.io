# Eiger

Eiger is an Alps cluster that provides compute nodes and file systems designed to meet the needs
of CPU-only workloads for the HPC Platform. For more information, please refer to the
[CSCS Documentation :material-open-in-new:](https://docs.cscs.ch/clusters/eiger/){:target="_blank"}.

C2SM only provides partial support for Eiger. Nevertheless,  you can find instructions on how
to set up ICON on Eiger at the [Compile section of ICON](../models/icon/compile.md#eiger).
