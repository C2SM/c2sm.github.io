# User Support

User Support refers to the Core Team's efforts to ensure that all supported software runs correctly on supported computer systems. This includes hosting the software for easy distribution to members, regular testing and helping members resolve issues with running and compiling. Find information about supported [tools](../tools/index.md) and [models](../models/index.md) in the corresponding sections.
